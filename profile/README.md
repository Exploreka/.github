# Hi there, welcome to Exploreka ðŸ‘‹

The Covid-19 pandemic has seriously affected Indonesia's tourism industry, with only 4,05 million tourists entering in 2020, this is only 25% compared to revenue in 2019. This decline has seriously affected the country's foreign exchange earnings. Even though Indonesia has tremendous tourism potential, several problems hinder the development of the industry. Among them are the lack of information, difficult access, uneven distribution of tourist objects, and promotions that are less attractive. To overcome these challenges, tourism applications that provide complete information about tourist attractions, tour guides, and 360 virtual tour features can increase tourist interest and enhance their travel planning experience.
